# StaticAI
Analyze malware PE using AI solutions:

- using a python script to use Capstone and Gemini AI
- using directly a reverse engeering model from Chatgbt, test the best efficient prompts
- doing an asm extract from IDA and then feed it to AI

Goal:
Identify which workflow most reliably approaches the official human analysis, especially for extracting concrete IOCs (e.g., C2 IPs/domains).
